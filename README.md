# Aviation-Nodejs-API-Express-Mongodb

This is a project I am starting, to build an application for Aviation, it will first follow a course I found for me to learn the basics,
Then I will branch off and form the application to my liking.

# Backend

```
npm install
```

start script, cd into backend/ and type:

```
npm run dev
```

(npm start (for production))
